# Personal Assistant (C++ Console Application)

This project is a console-based Personal Assistant developed in C++.
It provides basic assistant-like functionalities such as opening applications, displaying the current time, performing calculations, and handling files. The program is menu-driven and interacts with the user through text commands in the terminal.

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate core C++ concepts including:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Functions and templates

File handling

Standard Library usage

User input processing

# Features

Display current system time

Perform basic calculations

File handling operations

Open system applications using commands

Continuous interaction until user exits

Clean and simple console output

# Technologies Used

Language: C++

Compiler: GCC / MinGW / MSVC

# Libraries Used:

iostream

ctime

fstream

cstdlib

algorithm

# Caution

This C++ program is only suitable to windows only not for mac at the time. So, in future when we will get to know about more dept and more libraries of C++ we will make sure to resolve that issue.
(cstdlib) function system used in this program used start to open websites and apps that is only for windows but mac for mac it uses open and calc is not in mac.
