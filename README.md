# Personal Assistant (C++ Console Application)

This project is a console-based Personal Assistant developed in C++.
First User have to write userid and password to interact with the personal assistent. user.txt is the file where the userid and password must be written to let the personal assistent run. If userid and password written on the terminal does not matches then it will tell incorrect id or pass,
It provides basic assistant-like functionalities such as opening applications, displaying the current time, performing calculations, and handling files after logging in. The program is menu-driven and interacts with the user through text commands in the terminal.

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate core C++ concepts including:
